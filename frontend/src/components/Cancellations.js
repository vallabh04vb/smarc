1. Event Cancellations by Organizers

•Right to Cancel: The SMARC organizing committee reserves the right to cancel or reschedule any event or activity at its discretion due to unforeseen circumstances, including but not limited to, low registration numbers, venue availability, speaker cancellations, or any force majeure events.
•Notification: In the event of a cancellation or rescheduling, registered participants will be notified as soon as possible via the contact information provided during registration.
•Refunds: If an event is cancelled by the organizers and no alternative arrangement is provided, participants will be eligible for a full refund of the registration fees paid. Refunds will be processed within [Insert Number of Days] business days from the date of the cancellation notice.

2. Participant Cancellations

•Cancellation Requests: If you wish to cancel your participation in an event, you must submit a cancellation request in writing to [Email us at zavians.smarc2024@gmail.com] no later than [7 days before the event start date].
•Refund Eligibility: Participants who cancel within the specified deadline are eligible for a partial refund of the registration fee, minus a [Insert Percentage or Flat Fee] administrative fee. 
•No Refunds for Late Cancellations: Cancellations made after the specified deadline will not be eligible for a refund. However, you may transfer your registration to another eligible participant by notifying the organizers in advance.

4. Changes to Events

•Right to Modify: The SMARC organizing committee reserves the right to make changes to event schedules, venues, speakers, or content without prior notice. While every effort will be made to inform participants of significant changes, no refunds will be provided for such modifications unless they result in the cancellation of the event.




5. Force Majeure

•Unforeseen Circumstances: In the event that SMARC is unable to host the event due to circumstances beyond its control (including but not limited to natural disasters, acts of terrorism, pandemics, or government regulations), the organizing committee will either reschedule the event or provide participants with a refund option. The decision on refunds will be communicated to participants, and any applicable refunds will be processed within three to four business days.


6. Processing of Refunds

•Refund Method: Refunds will be issued using the original payment method. For credit/debit card payments, refunds will be credited back to the original card. For bank transfers, refunds will be made to the original bank account.
•Processing Time: Refunds will be processed within two business days of the cancellation request or event cancellation notice. Please note that additional time may be required for the refunded amount to appear in your account, depending on your bank or payment provider.
